This is a guide on how to assign static IPs to linux server running netplan

The networking configuration file is located at /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml(The last file varies depending on the server)

To assign a static IP address to ens3 interface, edit the file as follows:

Set DHCP to dhcp4: no.

Specify the static IP address 192.168.121.199/24. Under addresses: you can add one or more IPv4 or IPv6 IP addresses that will be assigned to the network interface.

Specify the gateway gateway4: 192.168.121.1

Under nameservers, set the IP addresses of the nameservers addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]

network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens3:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.121.199/24
      gateway4: 192.168.121.1
      nameservers:
          addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
          
          
When editing Yaml files, make sure you follow the YAML code indent standards. If there are syntax errors in the configuration, the changes will not be applied.


Save and apply the configurations run the command
 
$ sudo netplan apply
 
To verify the changes use the command;

$ ip addr show dev ens3
